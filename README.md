# electrokinetic_flow_macro_scale_problem
This repository provide a set of Matlab code for solving the macro scale problem derived in Schnitzer et al. (J.Fluid Mech. 753, 49-79, 2014)

## An Academic Project at New Jersey Institute of Technology

## Prerequistite

This project requires Matlab 2015R or later version to run the code for solving the problem.

### Code

The matlab code consists a set of reusable function files and one script. The script are used to solve for background fluid velocity with respect to different magnitudes of zeta potential and applied electric field.
 
### Run

The scripts' file name is UBZ, you can run the script file by swithcing current editor to the script file and clicking the 'run' button, or type in the script's file name in the command window and press enter. 

### Adjusting parameters

The parameters for the problems can be adjusted within the corresponding script.
